                    I find myself haunting these days<br>
                    I'm drowning in your memory, our memories <br>
                    I'm drowning beside you<br>
                    Every moment to me you are drowning<br><br>
                    
                    I hear your cries in your bedroom facing the sea<br>
                    And it was not so many years ago, <br>
                    in this palace by the sea<br>
                    where we loved with a love that was more than love<br>

                    But only one in name<br>
                    The other of less fame<br>
                    The walls now are getting in the way<br><br>
                    
                    They'll burn me in this rendition<br>
                    Shame and denial scorching through <br>
                    Until the last moment,<br>
                    I shall hold your name I could never take<br>

                    Why didn't you tell me you were dying?<br>
                    I'd always thought you drowned. <br>
                    You seem to me to be drowning most of your life.<br>
