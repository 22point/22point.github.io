                        Dear Susan, <br><br> I am afraid I will not be able to attend book club this week. <i>I seem to have lost my head. </i> 
                        And right when I had just lit a new cigarrette.
                           I just hope blood stains are easier to remove than grease stains!<br><br>No need to fret, it's been an off-week for the hubby. 
                           I'll be sure to return your tupperware at the boy's sports event this Tuesday.
                            <br><br>
                            Fondly,<br>
                            [REDACTED]<br><br>
                            P.S. Have you ever thought much about Death? Father Thomas always talks about the revealing 
                            of God in the details. I feel I can't piece together the meanings anymore. I have been keeping track of words that start with 'R' in the 
                            5 o'clock news, but the Morse code from below has stopped all together. <br><br>I don't fear Death anymore. It has been revealed to me that a much 
                            greater horror lies in living. In living. And living. and living. Continuous, unblinking, unresting, perpetual consciousness. The static grows in
                            volume. Sometimes I can see the Angels in front of me mouthing the words to Salvation I'll never hear.
                            <br><br>
                            ALSO. That casserole you brought to Dana's party was divine! You will have to give me the recipe next time you have 
                            the kids over to swim!</p>
